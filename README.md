# Bob & Rod's VR Carnival


### Introduction
- With Bob&Rod’s, our goal is to simulate the experience of a fun-filled carnival in a VR environment. Not everyone has access to a carnival near them so by recreating this experience in VR we hope to make fun and comforting carnival games more accessible. Each booth is inspired by classic carnival games. At Bob&Rod’s the user is able to enjoy Angry Birds, Put a Ring On It!, and Food Fight. Hitting cans, sliding in rings, and taking down dummy enemies, the user is able to rank up in points to test and perfect their carnival skills. 
- What makes Bob&Rod’s so interesting is the immersive experience and out-of-the-ordinary approaches to classic carnival games. At Angry Birds, the user is able to throw chickens at towers of cans to mimic the idea of the worldwide mobile game phenomenon, Angry Birds. At Put a Ring On It! the user is able to practice proposing to their special someone by throwing a ring on greater-than-life-sized fingers. At Food Fight, the user able to live out their high school fantasy of a high school cafeteria food fight by choosing one of many foodie weapons to fight dummy enemies.
- Bob&Rod’s utilization of VR enhances the carnival gameplay tenfold. Set at the bottom of a scenic mountain range, the user is able to be quickly immersed in the life of a carnival. Placed at the center of the three booths, the user is already provided the space to enjoy the world from all angles. With Angry Birds, the user is able to crash the cans with more than just a wiffle ball. With VR, the classic game of can toss can be viewed in a much more enticing and exciting way by throwing live chickens. With Put a Ring On It!, VR allows developers to take a creative spin on the game of ring toss by replacing the poles with fingers. As for Food Fight, the user must defend themselves from dummy enemies from all angles. With this booth, we are able to take advantage of the space that the VR medium grants us by allowing the user to physically move and rotate. 



### Design
`Landscape Design`
- When designing the world of Bob&Rod’s, it was important to us that despite the short timeline to complete the project, we wanted to ensure the user’s experience is up to par with fully scaled and implemented games. We did this by focussing on world-building. Taking advantage of free assets from the Unity Asset store, we kept close to a low-poly aesthetic by utilizing a handful of assets to build a landscape that encapsulated our carnival. Adding numerous trees, mountain ranges, hot air balloons, and a few clouds, the attention to detail was something we prioritized to grab the attention of the user and increase immersion as well as enjoyment.
