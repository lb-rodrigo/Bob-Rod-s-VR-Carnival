# Bob & Rod's VR Carnival


### Introduction
- With Bob&Rod’s, our goal is to simulate the experience of a fun-filled carnival in a VR environment. Not everyone has access to a carnival near them so by recreating this experience in VR we hope to make fun and comforting carnival games more accessible. Each booth is inspired by classic carnival games. At Bob&Rod’s the user is able to enjoy Angry Birds, Put a Ring On It!, and Food Fight. Hitting cans, sliding in rings, and taking down dummy enemies, the user is able to rank up in points to test and perfect their carnival skills. 
- What makes Bob&Rod’s so interesting is the immersive experience and out-of-the-ordinary approaches to classic carnival games. At Angry Birds, the user is able to throw chickens at towers of cans to mimic the idea of the worldwide mobile game phenomenon, Angry Birds. At Put a Ring On It! the user is able to practice proposing to their special someone by throwing a ring on greater-than-life-sized fingers. At Food Fight, the user able to live out their high school fantasy of a high school cafeteria food fight by choosing one of many foodie weapons to fight dummy enemies.
- Bob&Rod’s utilization of VR enhances the carnival gameplay tenfold. Set at the bottom of a scenic mountain range, the user is able to be quickly immersed in the life of a carnival. Placed at the center of the three booths, the user is already provided the space to enjoy the world from all angles. With Angry Birds, the user is able to crash the cans with more than just a wiffle ball. With VR, the classic game of can toss can be viewed in a much more enticing and exciting way by throwing live chickens. With Put a Ring On It!, VR allows developers to take a creative spin on the game of ring toss by replacing the poles with fingers. As for Food Fight, the user must defend themselves from dummy enemies from all angles. With this booth, we are able to take advantage of the space that the VR medium grants us by allowing the user to physically move and rotate. 



### Related Works
- Our team had the opportunity to see and try other virtual reality experiences created by our classmates. A particular experience our team really enjoyed was project called The Ascent which put us in situation where we had to escape a maze. The user is tasked with collecting keys in the dark to earn their freedom from the maze with only a flashlight at their disposal. Given that their game is all about movement through a maze, one aspect of the game we found very creative was the team's game design to hide the count of collected keys in the user’s virtual hand. In comparison, to our team’s carnival experience it made intuitive sense to have a scoreboard within each game booth. This decision in our opinion not only made the game look more aesthetic but also heightened immersion by not displaying a menu in the user’s field of view limiting game visibility.
-  	In similar behavior, an aspect of their game we really enjoyed was the implementation of auditory feedback. Throughout the experience, we received multiple unique audio feedbacks tethered to specific actions in the game: collecting keys, switching on/off the flashlight, and completing the maze. The addition of these sound effects made the game much more enjoyable and immersive while helping our team notice the value of auditory feedback. Shortly after playing their game, we integrated light and family-friendly background music into Bob&Rod’s.
-  	A different virtual reality experience that caught our eye was a cooking game developed by another group. This interactive cooking experience took place inside a virtual kitchen with access to amenities such as a sink, refrigerator, cutting board, and other kitchen necessities. However, aside from these kitchen amenities that were absolutely essential for gameplay the kitchen environment and overall VR world lacked detail. We believe that what makes a VR experiences engaging is taking advantage of the medium by designing visually dynamic environments. In contrast to our VR carnival, we ensure our environment has many assets that made world visually compelling from all angles: clouds, hot air balloons, trees and far away mountains. Incorporating a 360 Degree visual experience that is filled with world-building details, it allows the user to be immersed into the world of Bob&Rod’s and engaged with its contents.
